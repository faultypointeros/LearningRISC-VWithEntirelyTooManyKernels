# Introduction to RISC-V

### History
- ISA originally designed for computer architecture research and education

### Goals
- completely open ISA
- real ISA suitable for native hardware implementations
- not designed for specific microarch or implementation technology but allowing implementation of any
- ISA seperated into a small but usable base and other standarized extentions
- support for parallel multicore and manycore
- virtualizable ISA for easy hypervisor developement
